        "llm_answer": "Based on the provided data, here's an analysis of whether the *Contagion* spell would be effective against these undead monsters:\n\n*   ***Contagion* Spell:** The *Contagion* spell typically requires a creature to make Constitution saving throws to avoid being infected with a disease. The spell has varying effects depending on the disease chosen, but many of these effects involve conditions like being poisoned, paralyzed, or incapacitated.\n\n*   **Undead Immunities:** Many undead creatures have specific immunities that would make *Contagion* ineffective. The most common and relevant of these are:\n\n    *   **Poisoned Condition:** Many undead are immune to the *Poisoned* condition. Since some of the effects of *Contagion* rely on imposing the *Poisoned* condition, this immunity would negate those effects.\n\n    *   **Poison Damage:** Many are immune to poison damage.\n\n    *   **Other Conditions:** Some undead are immune to conditions like *Paralyzed*, *Charmed*, or *Exhaustion*, which might be inflicted by certain *Contagion* diseases.\n\n*   **Specific Undead Analysis:** Looking at the undead in the data:\n\n    *   **Zombie and Ogre Zombie:** Both are immune to *Poison* damage and the *Poisoned* condition. This makes *Contagion* largely ineffective against them.\n\n    *   **Vampire Spawn:** No specific immunity to any condition that would protect them from Contagion.\n\n    *   **Wraith:** Immune to the *Poisoned* condition.\n\n    *   **Shadow:** Immune to the *Poisoned* condition, *Exhaustion*, *Frightened*, *Grappled*, *Paralyzed*, *Petrified*, *Prone*, and *Restrained*. This makes *Contagion* ineffective against them.\n\n    *   **Ghast:** Immune to the *Poisoned* condition, *Charmed*, and *Exhaustion*.\n\n    *   **Wight:** Immune to the *Poisoned* condition, and *Exhaustion*.\n\n    *   **Ghost:** Immune to the *Poisoned* condition, *Charmed*, *Exhaustion*, *Frightened*, *Grappled*, *Paralyzed*, *Petrified*, *Prone*, and *Restrained*. This makes *Contagion* ineffective against them.\n\n    *   **Lich:** Immune to the *Poisoned* condition, *Charmed*, *Exhaustion*, *Frightened*, and *Paralyzed*. This makes *Contagion* ineffective against them.\n\n    *   **Skeleton:** Immune to the *Poisoned* condition and *Exhaustion*. This makes *Contagion* largely ineffective against them.\n\n**Conclusion:** *Contagion*'s effectiveness against undead is highly variable and depends on the specific undead creature and the chosen disease effect. Most undead have immunities (especially to the *Poisoned* condition) that significantly reduce or negate the spell's impact.\n\n",

        "llm_answer": "No, you cannot cast spells with your action as normal on rounds 2 and 3. Here's why:\n\n1.  **Readying a Spell:** When you ready a spell, you are holding the spell's energy, waiting for a specific trigger. You've already begun the casting process, but you're delaying the release of the magic until the trigger occurs.\n\n2.  **Action Economy:** Readying a spell uses your action on the turn you ready it. Since you've spent your action readying, you can't also use your action to cast another spell.\n\n3.  **Concentration (Potential Issue):** If the spell you are readying requires concentration, you cannot cast another concentration spell.\n\nTherefore, on rounds 2 and 3, you wouldn't be able to cast additional spells using your action because you've already committed to readying the *magic missile* spell.
