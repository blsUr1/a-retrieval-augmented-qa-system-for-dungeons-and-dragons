    "Next, the remaining API endpoints are processed in a manner analogous to the previously described procedure. First, a request is sent to fetch the list of entries, and an empty dictionary is initialized to store the results. For each entry, the `name` attribute is extracted, the complete details are retrieved via a secondary request, and the description is standardized using the `preprocess_text` function. Both the `name` and the cleaned `desc` are then stored into a dictionary. Only information relevant to the intended QA system is retained; for instance, attributes like `url` are disregarded, as they are not essential. Optional fields including `races`, `subraces`, and `proficiencies` are incorporated only if present in the API response, since not all endpoints provdide values for these attributes. If a response is associated with specific races or subraces, an additional flag `exclusive_to_stated_races` is set to `True`. Finally, each entry is inserted into a dictionary using its `index` as the key."
