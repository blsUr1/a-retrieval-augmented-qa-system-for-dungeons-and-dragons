I had a warrior that had a -3 AC. My question:  Is AC the higher the number the better now, and how do you roll to hit?  If a character has a 16AC, do i roll a D20 with modifiers and if that number is greater than 16, is the attack successful? Inititive is another thing as we used to all roll D20's and the highest number goes first.  Is this still the case?

Is Divine Smite then considered a spell? My DM said because you expend spell slots for Divine Smite it's considered a spell. Since I didn't expend enough spell slots to be considered above 6th level, because I can't, the Divine Smite damage didn't take affect. That sounds wrong to me since Divine Smite is not a spell, but a class ability. I take the use of spell slots just means it takes away from me casting spells. What is the ruling on this?
