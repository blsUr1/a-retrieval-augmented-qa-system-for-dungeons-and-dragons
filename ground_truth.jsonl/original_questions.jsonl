Is Divine Smite then considered a spell? My DM said because you expend spell slots for Divine Smite it's considered a spell. Since I didn't expend enough spell slots to be considered above 6th level, because I can't, the Divine Smite damage didn't take affect. That sounds wrong to me since Divine Smite is not a spell, but a class ability. I take the use of spell slots just means it takes away from me casting spells. What is the ruling on this?
